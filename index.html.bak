        <!-- ONLINE POSITIONING -->
        <p>
          <strong>Scoundrel is a single-player roguelike dungeon card game you can play online in your browser.</strong>
          Inspired by the original Scoundrel ruleset, the goal is to survive the dungeon with as much health as
          possible.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Play Scoundrel</h2>

        <h3>Starting the Game</h3>
        <p>
          You begin with <strong>20 health</strong>. The dungeon is represented by a shuffled deck of cards.
          Each turn, <strong>four cards</strong> are revealed to form a room.
        </p>

        <h3>The Cards</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Monsters</strong> deal damage equal to their strength, ranging from <strong>2 to 14</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Weapons</strong> reduce the damage you take from monsters.
          Equipping a new weapon replaces your previous one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Health Potions</strong> restore health equal to their value.
          You may drink <strong>only one potion per room</strong>, and your health cannot exceed 20.
        </p>

        <h3>Facing a Room</h3>
        <p>
          Each room contains four cards. You must resolve <strong>three of them</strong>,
          leaving one card behind to carry forward into the next room.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may choose to <strong>avoid a room</strong>, placing all four cards back into the dungeon.
          However, you may <strong>not avoid two rooms in a row</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Combat Rules</h3>
        <p>When facing a monster, you have two options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Barehanded:</strong> Take damage equal to the monster’s full strength.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>With a weapon:</strong> Subtract the weapon’s power from the monster’s value.
            Any remaining damage is taken as health loss.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once a weapon is used to slay a monster, it becomes <strong>bound</strong>.
          From that point on, it may only be used against monsters of
          <strong>equal or lower strength</strong> than the last monster it defeated.
        </p>

        <h3>Winning and Losing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Your health reaches <strong>zero</strong> — you lose.</li>
          <li>You clear the entire dungeon — you win.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you win, your remaining health is your score.
          Every decision matters — knowing when to fight, heal, or run is the heart of Scoundrel.
